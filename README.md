My name is Erikk Holdern!
I'm a Minecraft player who likes programming and I wanted to get into modding lately, so I started this account to hopefully post some repositories of my Minecraft mods.

I'm currently learning Finnish and French, I'm a senior in high school, and I love storywriting and linguistics (and consequently, conlangs).

ErikkHoldern/ErikkHoldern is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
